    "Participants of this project were hired from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform. They were invited to log onto a website that housed a demographic survey, a series of typing tests, an argumentative writing task, and a vocabulary knowledge test. Participants were required to use only computers with a keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the argumentative writing task, participants were asked to write an argumentative essay within 30 minutes in response to a writing prompt adapted from a retired Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) taken by high school students attempting to enter post-secondary institutions in the United States. To control for potential prompt effects, four SAT-based writing prompts were used and each participant was randomly assigned one prompt. Prior to the writing task, instructions were presented on the integral components in an argumentative essay (e.g., introduction, position, reasons and evidence) along with descriptions of their functions in argumentation. The instructions pages also introduced a set of rules for the writing task. These include that participants should write an essay of at least 200 words in 3 paragraphs and that they should not use any online or offline reference materials. To make sure participants stayed focused on the task during writing and to track behavior, the writing task page issued warnings whenever the participant was detected inactive for more than 2 minutes or moved to a new window in the process of writing."
