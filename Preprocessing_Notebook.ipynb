    "Participants of this project were hired from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform. They were invited to log onto a website that housed a demographic survey, a series of typing tests, an argumentative writing task, and a vocabulary knowledge test. Participants were required to use only computers with a keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the argumentative writing task, participants were asked to write an argumentative essay within 30 minutes in response to a writing prompt adapted from a retired Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) taken by high school students attempting to enter post-secondary institutions in the United States. To control for potential prompt effects, four SAT-based writing prompts were used and each participant was randomly assigned one prompt. Prior to the writing task, instructions were presented on the integral components in an argumentative essay (e.g., introduction, position, reasons and evidence) along with descriptions of their functions in argumentation. The instructions pages also introduced a set of rules for the writing task. These include that participants should write an essay of at least 200 words in 3 paragraphs and that they should not use any online or offline reference materials. To make sure participants stayed focused on the task during writing and to track behavior, the writing task page issued warnings whenever the participant was detected inactive for more than 2 minutes or moved to a new window in the process of writing. A screenshot of the writing task page is presented below."

    "**Production Rate**  \n",
    "The rate of written language production can be measured by counting the number of characters, words, clauses, sentences, or T-units in the writing process or written product generated per unit of time. Example measures are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* number of characters (including spaces) produced per minute during the process\n",
    "* number of characters (including spaces) produced per minute in the product\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pause**  \n",
    "Pauses are generally defined as inter-keystroke intervals (IKI) above a certain threshold (e.g., 2000 milliseconds). The IKI refers to the gap time between two consecutive key presses typically expressed in milliseconds. To illustrate, suppose a writer types a character \"A\" at time 1 and then a character \"B\" at time 2. One can obtain the IKI between the two characters simply using the formula: IKI = Time2 - Time1. Global measures of pausing are usually associated with the duration and frequency of pauses calculated from different dimensions. Below are some typical pause measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* number of pauses (in total or per minute)\n",
    "* proportion of pause time (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "* pause length (usually the mean duration of all pauses in text production)\n",
    "* pause lengths or frequencies within words, between words, between sentences, between paragraphs, etc.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Revision**  \n",
    "Revisions are operations of deletions or insertions in writing. A deletion is defined as the removal of any stretch of characters from a text whereas an insertion refers to a sequence of activities to add characters to a growing text (except the end). Below are some commonly used revision measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* number of deletions (in total or per minute)\n",
    "* number of insertions (in total or per minute)\n",
    "* length of deletions (in characters)\n",
    "* length of insertions (in characters)\n",
    "* proportion of deletions (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "* proportion of insertions (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "* product vs. process ratio (The number of characters in the product divided by the number of characters produced during the writing process)\n",
    "* number/length of revisions at the point of inscription (i.e., at the current end of a text being produced)\n",
    "* number/length of revisions after the text has been transcribed (i.e., at a previous point in the text)\n",
    "* number of immediate revisions (the distance between the position of the flashing cursor and the revision point equal to zero)\n",
    "* number of distant revisions (the distance between the position of the flashing cursor and the revision point larger than zero)\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Burst**  \n",
    "Bursts refer to the periods in text production in which stretches of texts were continuously produced with no pauses and/or revisions. There are mainly two types of bursts: P-bursts that refer to the written segments terminated by pauses, and R-bursts that describe the segments terminated by an evaluation, revision or other grammatical discontinuity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* number of P-bursts (in total or per minute)\n",
    "* number of R-bursts (in total or per minute)\n",
    "* proportion of P-bursts (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "* proportion of R-bursts (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "* length of P-bursts (in characters)\n",
    "* length of R-bursts (in characters)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Process Variance**  \n",
    "Process variance attends to the dynamics of the writing process in relation to time and thus represents how the writer's fluency may differ at different stages.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Process variance is generally measured by first dividing the whole writing process into a certain number of equal time intervals (e.g., 5 or 10) and then calculating the total number of characters produced in the intervals (often normalized to the average number of characters per minute), or to make it more comparable among writers, the proportion of characters produced per interval. The standard deviation of characters produced per interval is also calculated from keystroke logs as an indicator of process variance."
